# DockTemplate

**DockTemplate** is a starter framework for building **IDE-style, plugin-driven desktop applications** with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).  
It goes beyond simple docking demos by enabling **real collaboration and extensibility** out of the box.

## Why DockTemplate?

DockTemplate shows **how to build an application and the ecosystem around it**:

- üîë **Debug as Source** ‚Äì Develop plugins inside your solution, step through them in the debugger, and treat them like first-class code.  
- üì¶ **Ship as Plugins** ‚Äì At build time, the same code is emitted as a standalone `.dockplugin` package.  
- ü§ù **Team Collaboration** ‚Äì Share functionality across teams without sharing source code. Drop in a plugin (e.g. a custom editor, visualization, or dashboard) and it ‚Äújust works.‚Äù  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Loose Coupling** ‚Äì Components communicate via lightweight messages, not hard dependencies. This keeps plugins independent and apps maintainable.  
- üåó **Ready to Go** ‚Äì Includes theming, logging, file explorer, and extensibility points so you don‚Äôt start from scratch.

Think of DockTemplate as a **cross-platform VS Shell**:  
a lightweight foundation where functionality grows organically through plugins.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo and run the starter app.  
2. Build or grab a `.dockplugin` file.  
3. Drop it into the `Plugins` folder and restart.  
4. Your new tool appears docked and fully functional ‚Äî no core changes needed.

## Current Status

- Complete dockable IDE layout with working panels
- Component system: each control on the UX is fully standalone, loaded or installed! Check DockComponent.Base/README.md file.
- Beautiful Material Design icons with VS Code-inspired colors  
- Real-time logging with filtering (try different log levels!)
- File explorer with intelligent file type recognition
- Light/Dark theme switching
- Solid ReactiveUI + DI architecture
- Charting and data visualization examples in development
- Error List - double click on Error in Errors tab to jump to source
  
**Will there be more?**
Yes, this project will be perpetually expanded with snippets I find useful in my other pet projects. 
Coming soon:
- More real-world integration patterns being added
- .NET template for auto-generation of the base for your tools
- list will be expanded as we go :)
